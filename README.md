# home_automation

This project will automate multiple things at home. Starting with the indoor lighting then potentially moving on to outdoor lighting, access control (gate, doors etc).

The mobile app is built in Dart with Flutter. This controls the lights and other periphery items. 

Output (actions controlled by the app) input data (data sent to the app) is mainly controlled by an Arduino microcontroller with the relevant sensors.
